# Fortran Examples

This repo primarily serves as a place for me to organize Fortran examples and
learn from the topics I am interested in.

A lot of the examples will probably come from
[https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/quickstart/).
I had a lot of these coded up before, but then I accidentally `git reset --hard`
right after I made this repo and they were lost. C'est la vie or something, idk,
I'm American.

# Reading List

Take a look at [my reading list](./reading_list.md). It will contain various
links and or other things to read. I will likely put notes on it as I read them.
